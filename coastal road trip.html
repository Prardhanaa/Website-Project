  <h1>Coastal Road Trip: The Hidden Gems</h1>
  <p class="date-author">Published on August 9, 2025 by Waves & Wonders</p>
  
  <p>Embarking on a coastal road trip is one of the best ways to experience the beauty and charm of hidden gems along the shore. Whether you’re a seasoned traveler or a weekend adventurer, this guide will help you plan a relaxing and scenic journey.</p>
  
  <h2>Planning Your Route</h2>
  <p>Start by mapping out key stops, prioritizing small towns, scenic viewpoints, and local eateries. Avoid major highways when possible to enjoy the coastal views and quaint vibes.</p>
  
  <h2>Must-Visit Stops</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Seaside Village:</strong> A charming town known for its artisan shops and fresh seafood markets.</li>
    <li><strong>Cliffside Lookout:</strong> Offers breathtaking panoramic views of the ocean and is perfect for a picnic.</li>
    <li><strong>Hidden Cove:</strong> A quiet beach spot with crystal-clear water, ideal for swimming and snorkeling.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Food & Snacks</h2>
  <p>Pack a picnic basket with local treats or stop at roadside stands offering fresh fruits and homemade pastries. Don’t miss the opportunity to try the regional specialties at family-run diners.</p>
  
  <h2>Tips for a Smooth Trip</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Check your vehicle before the trip — tire pressure, oil, and fuel.</li>
    <li>Bring plenty of water and sun protection.</li>
    <li>Download offline maps to stay connected in areas with poor reception.</li>
    <li>Take your time and enjoy spontaneous stops along the way.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Remember, the joy of a road trip is in the journey itself — so slow down, take photos, and soak in the coastal magic.</p>
